This directory is used to publish a compiled javac.jar to Sonatype, making it
available to Maven users. For instructions, see the README.google file in the
parent directory.

The fake-sources.jar and fake-javadoc.jar files are required for the Sonatype
Central Repository.  Their documentation instructs us to create fake artifacts
for these when needed to pass the checking.  See
http://central.sonatype.org/pages/requirements.html.
